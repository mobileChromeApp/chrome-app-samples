<p><b>Tableau</b> (Forty-nine cards in seven columns. At the start of the game, 
seven cards are dealt to each column. In the first four columns, three cards are 
face down and four face up. In the next three columns, all cards are face up.)</p>

<li>When an entire suite of thirteen cards becomes exposed, it is automatically 
removed from the tableau.</li>
<li>Any face up card, no matter how deep it is in a column, may be moved to make 
a build. All covering cards are moved with it as a unit.</li>
<li>Spaces may be filled only with a King, a King-sequence or a King with any 
covering cards.</li>
<li>A King cannot move, except to an empty space.</li>
<li>Nothing can be placed on an Ace.</li>
<li>The game is won if the entire deck in all four suites is discarded and 
nothing is left on the tableau.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Stock</b> (Three cards face down)</p>
<ul>
<li>After all possible moves have been made, the three cards in this pile are 
dealt onto the first three columns of the tableau to create more possibilities.</li>
<li>There is no redeal.</li>
</ul>

<h3><img src="solitaire/help/images/strategy.png" height="26" width="26"> Strategy</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It is imperative that the face down cards be uncovered as soon as 
	possible.</li>
