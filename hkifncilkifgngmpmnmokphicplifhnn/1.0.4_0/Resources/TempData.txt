    "Story": "KOLKATA: The roots of success of Mamata Banerjee, who fought the CPM single-handedly in ending its 34-year rule in West Bengal, was in striking a fine balance between the aspirations of the agriculture and industry sectors and the state's development. \n\nThe party could bag 184 out of 294 Assembly seats in the state on Banerjee's ability to project herself as a leader of the poor and the rural have-nots, a friend of minorities, a champion of inclusive growth and one genuinely interested in delivering the goods. \n\nWhile capitalising on the fear of farmers that they would lose their land to industry, she also managed to assure investors that their interests would not be overlooked. \n\nTrinamool Congress, which was relatively weak in North Bengal than the Congress and the Left Front, emerged as a major force in the region, where Mamata Banerjee played the development card by inaugurating various railway projects and flagging off a number of trains to improve the region's connectivity. \n\nIn North Bengal, where the Trinamool Congress held only the Dinhata Assembly seat in the 2006 elections, it bagged 16 of the 54 seats, while ally Congress won 17. \n\nIn 2006, the region had 49 seats, 38 of which were won by the Left Front. This time, the Front managed to win only 16 seats while the Gorkha Janmukti Moracha bagged three seats and Independents two. \n\nThe Trinamool saw huge success in South Dinajpur district bagging five of the six seats, while its candidate in Siliguri Rudranath Bhattacharya defeated CPM heavyweight Ashok Bhattacharya, known as the 'chief minister' of North Bengal. \n\nWith Ashok Bhattacharya's defeat, Trinamool was able to break ground in Darjeeling district which has six seats, three of which were bagged by GJM and two by Congress. \n\nSeeking to turn the GJM's Gorkhaland agitation to its advantage, the CPM tried to play on the majority Bengali sentiments in the plains of Darjeeling against the Gorkhaland \"threat,\" but the effort did not cut ice with the voters. \n\nIn the Maoist-hit districts of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura which account for 40 seats, the Trinamool Congress did not get a single seat in 2006, but could break the CPM monopoly this time by winning 21 seats, thanks to Banerjee's tireless efforts in mobilising her support base. \n\nWhile the Left Front, especially the CPM, relentlessly accused her of having a nexus with the Maoists, she played her cards well by carving out a development path for Junglemahal. While she denounced individual killings on one hand, she also raised her voice against the action by the joint forces, saying common people were being harassed. \n "

    "Story": "WASHINGTON: A US Navy Seal told then President George Bush that he just needed his permission to \"go into Pakistan and kick ass\" when the President asked him if he had everything he needed at the height of the war on terror in the AfPak theatre. \n\nThe astonishing exchange, related by the former President himself in a reaction to Osama bin Laden's extermination, reveals the extent to which the US military believed Pakistan is sheltering terrorists and playing a double game, a perfidy that Washington politicians glossed over because of political and diplomatic compulsions. \n\nMany US military personnel have privately champed at the bit at being held back from punishing a former ally, but it is the first time the extent of their animosity has been made public through such a colourful exchange, that too by a President who once called Pakistan's military ruler Pervez Musharraf his \"tight buddy.\"\n\nBut while the Washington establishment promoted the fiction of Islamabad being a partner in the war on terror, US forces in Afghanistan quickly figured out it was anything but, recalling numerous instances of Pakistani forces giving cover to terrorists attacking them across the border and retreating into Pakistan -- much the same way Indian forces experienced Pakistan Army backed infiltration in Kashmir for many years. \n\nPresident Bush's recollection of the exchange with the Navy Seal during a visit to Afghanistan came at a conference of hedge fund bigwigs in Las Vegas this week when he spoke of Osama bin Laden's death. \n\nHe said he was tucking into a plate of crab meat souffle at a restaurant when he got the call from President Obama that bin Laden had been killed. \"I excused myself and went home to take the call. Obama simply said, 'Osama bin Laden is dead.' \"Bush recalled.\n\nAfter Obama explained his decision to authorize the May 2 raid that killed the al-Qaida founder, Bush said he told Obama, \"Good call.\"\n\n\"The guy is dead. That is good,\" Bush said of the US success, but added he was personally \"not overjoyed\" at the death. Still, he said, \"Osama's death is a great victory in the war on terror. He was held up as a leader . . . The intelligence services deserve a lot of credit. They built a mosaic of information, piece by piece.\" \n\nBush then recounted meeting SEAL Team Six, which executed the bin Laden raid, during a trip to Afghanistan when he was President. \"They are awesome, skilled, talented and brave,\" he said. \"I said, 'I hope you have everything you need.' One guy said, 'We need your permission to go into Pakistan and kick ass.\"' Bush did not say if he gave them the permission, although there were one reported instance of US troops going inside Pakistan and engaging in a firefight, besides many covert operations. \n\nThe Bush-Navy Seal anecdote comes even as ties between the two militaries, once vaunted allies, has reached a nadir, with Pakistan's military dominated body politic on Friday threatening to withdraw transit facility to US/Nato troops in Afghanistan if US does cease incursions into Pakistan, including stopping drone attacks. A top Pakistani general scrubbed a scheduled visit to US even as Pakistan's biggest ally in Washington, Senator John Kerry, rushed to the region on a damage control mission. \n\nBut public mood in the US about Pakistan, reflected in media commentaries and even late night television (a good barometer of public opinion), is now intensely negative. \"Like most Americans, we have long despaired at the cynicism of Pakistan's leaders, who accept American \"counterterrorist\" aid while also sheltering and enabling some of the worst anti-American extremists,\" The New York Times said in an editorial on the weekend, adding, \"We see no sign that Pakistan is ready to stop playing all sides, or will ever figure out that the fight against extremists isn't a favor to the United States but essential to its own survival.\" "

    "PhotoCaption": "A bunch of Twitter users have come together to gather information about power cuts in India.",
    "Story": "NEW DELHI: A bunch of Twitter users have come together to gather information about power cuts in India and make an infographic that will map the geographical spread of power cuts across the country.\n\nIt all started when Shefaly Yogendra, a London-based investment consultant, saw a discussion on power cuts on her Twitter timeline and suggested to her friends, \"May be you guys SHOULD tweet #powercut with location. The infographic will highlight the need for investment. To many people.\"\n\nThe idea caught on. Users had begun writing about the time and location of the power cuts in their respective areas with the hashtag (a word preceded by a hash sign that helps categorise tweets) #powercutindia. About 28 minutes after the initial discussion, Ajay Kumar (username @ajuonline) put up a web page that had started mapping power cuts in the country on the basis of the tagged tweets. Now the page can be accessed at http://powercuts.in. A Twitter account by the name of @PowerCutsIn has also been employed to collect data.\n\nThe page is built on an Ushahidi platform, which provides free software for information collection. The same platform has been used earlier to collect information on incidents of violence in Kenya. While the updates from Twitter are being incorporated on to the map by a team of 11 moderators information received via the smartphone app updates the map automatically. \"I'm trying to get some people to code a page that will show the availability of power real-time,\" says Ajay Kumar, a software engineer working with a Lucknow-based NGO.\n\nFirst city to be mapped, according to Ajay on Twitter, was Gurgaon. In the first couple of days, 46 reports had been mapped, at a rate of 9.2 reports a day. These reports have further been sorted into categories of \"planned\", \"unplanned\", \"good news\" (indicating no power cuts) and \"voltage\".\n\nAn open Google document, which anyone can read, edit and shared, was also floated online, where people volunteered to do the data crunching, and provide tech support. Those involved are trying to take this beyond an empty data-visualisation exercise and trying to figure out what to do with it. Pitting this data against that of diesel prices and farm output are just some of the suggestions that have come in from users on the same Google document. Others suggested tweeting with pin-codes for better accuracy while representing the data on a map.\n\n\"We've got thousands of tweets coming in with this hashtag. We could use all this data to see the number of power cuts that weren't a part of planned load shedding by power companies,\" says Kumar.\n\nThere were discussions about roping in non-Twitter users as well for better reach. \"Two companies have already contacted me regarding this, saying they can offer their services for gathering data on the same through mobiles. Nothing has been finalized, though,\" says Kumar.\n\nCrowdsourcing, or getting a large group of people to provide data on a particular subject, has been a rage ever since the web went social. A similar mapping exercise, which maps mobile network problems in India, already exists online by the name of Mobile Telco #Fail.\n\nIn the UK, an online service has started mapping specific medical symptoms that people tweet about to study the spread of diseases. So if the map shows a substantial number of people in your area getting a sore throat and a running nose with fever, you know you shouldn't be taking your sniffles lightly.\n\nThe pace at which things are proceeding with this, it's hard to say where this would go. \"I have seen many online activism attempts fail. But I just jumped onto this one. People are coming up with some really sensible suggestions. Let's see where this goes,\" says Kumar.\n "

    "Story": "NEW DELHI: A special court on Saturday prolonged the suspense on the bail application of DMK MP Kanimozhi in the 2G spectrum case by deferring the pronouncement of its order till May 20. \n\n\"The order is deferred to May 20,\" Special CBI Judge O P Saini said after marking the presence of all the accused including 43-year-old Kanimozhi, daughter of DMK chief M Karunanidhi. \n\nSeeing a huge presence of journalists, Saini questioned as to why there were so many journalists and then simply passed the order. \n\nCBI lawyer A K Singh told reporters outside the court that the only reason which the judge gave for not pronouncing the order was that it was not ready. \n\nThe court also adjourned its pronouncement of order till May 20 on the bail plea of Sharad Kumar, MD and CEO of Kalaignar TV. \n\nKanimozhi was accompanied by her husband G Aravindan and DMK parliamentary party leader T R Baalu. \n\nEarlier, the court had on May 7 reserved its order on the bail pleas of Kanimozhi and Sharad Kumar after hearing extensive arguments advanced by criminal lawyer Ram Jethmalani who, citing the charge sheet, blamed former Telecom Minister A Raja for the offence attributed to Kanimozhi. \n\nThe special court, designated by the Supreme Court to deal exclusively with the 2G case, has to decide the fate of Kanimozhi who has been accused of taking Rs 200 crore bribe for Kalaignar TV from Shahid Usman Balwa's firm DB Realty. \n\nThe CBI has accused her of conspiring with Raja. She has also been charged under the Prevention of Corruption Act for taking bribe through Kalaignar TV--a channel run by the DMK -- in which the bribe of the 2G scam was routed. \n\nSpeaking to reporters after the court deferred its order on bail pleas of Kanimozhi and Sharad Kumar, Janata Party president Subramanian Swamy said Kanimozhi is not going to escape from CBI's clutches as more evidence against her is going to come up. \n\n\"I do not think she (Kanimozhi) is going to escape as more evidence is going to come. I do not think this matter is in any way showing that she is going to be let off or that the CBI is going easy on her,\" Swamy said. \n\nKanimozhi and Kumar hold 20 per cent stake each in Kalaignar TV while Karunanidhi's wife Dayalu Ammal, who holds the remaining 60 per cent share in the broadcasting channel, has been made a witness. \nKanimozhi appeared before the court on May 6 in compliance with the summons issued after she was named in the second chargesheet. \n\nPressing for Kanimozhi's bail, Jethmalani had sought to blame Raja and Sharad Kumar for the alleged offence saying she neither signed any documents nor handled affairs of the company. \n\n\"My misfortune is that I am Karunanidhi's daughter and an MP. I have 20 per cent shares in Kalaignar TV. Show me one overt act of mine which relates to the offence,\" he had said. \n\nHe had contended that apart from having 20 per cent shares in Kalaignar TV, she does not have any role in running its day-to-day affairs. \n\nCBI opposed her bail plea saying her \"complicity\" in the alleged bribe given to Kalaignar TV in the 2G scam was clear. \n\n\"The transactions (of Rs 200 crore) are nothing but the transfer of bribe money to Kalaignar TV. Kumar alone cannot be held responsible when a family is having the controlling shares,\" special public prosecutor U U Lalit had argued.\n "

    "Story": "PATNA: Among the city's teenagers, particularly boys, watching a 'blue film'-a euphemism for pornography- seems to have become a habit. Over the past few years, this furtive doing has taken over other extra-curricular activities.\n\nOn an investigative visit to different cybercafes in the city, this correspondent came across a revelation which may take parents aback.\n\nA check of the web browsing history at a cyber cafe in Boring Road revealed that of the 100 web pages, 80 page titles referred to pornographic materials and porn video downloads.\n\nCybercafes in the city are mostly frequented by school and college-going boys and girls. Visitors, constituting boys and girls in a virtually equal number, download porn movies in their mobile phones and also store them in data cards.\n\nCybercafe owners have not limited themselves to allowing porn surfing to the visitors. Many have jumped on the flesh trade bandwagon as well. They provide beds, girls and also condoms to those looking for them.\n\nDuring a raid on around 12-13 cybercafes in Gandhi Maidan, Kadamkuan, Kotwali and Buddha Colony police station areas on March 8, SP (City) Shivdeep Lande had found condoms and beds in a cybercafe.\n\nNot only that, the cops had also caught 40 and odd couples in compromising position. Most of the couples were students in the age group of 16 to 18 years, belonging to well-off families.\n\nIgniting the trend is easy accessibility of porn materials to these students. X-rated CDs and DVDs are flooding the city markets. It is alarming that children are the ones who are buying and selling them. Patna, of late, has become a major centre for the production and illegal sale of pornographic materials. Dozens of music shops are engaged in this business. \"The children always want new products. And come looking for them,\" said a CD seller on busy Fraser Road, near Buddha Smriti Park.\n\nAbout a dozen such stalls are situated around the railway station. Bakerganj, considered the city's largest electronic market, is believed to be the principal supplier of the CDs.\n\nSo high is the demand that a grocery shop near Kurji was found hoarding some of these DVDs. These shop owners display some popular CDs and then put the X-rated stuff beneath. Asked how they manage to escape the police net, he said, \"The cops themselves come looking for DVDs as bribe. We gift them when they come.\"\n\nIn proof that flesh trade has caught up in upmarket apartments, hotels, guesthouses and in beauty parlours, Patna police had caught bar girls dancing semi-naked at a restaurant situated on Fraser Road in the night of May 8. The police had caught four girls, three bikes, one SUV and a huge cache of liquor. Earlier, such raids had also been conducted in upmarket apartments and beauty parlours, among other places.\n\nThe Patna police are up against such elements. \"The police are actively working to check such elements. We will conduct raids whenever we get any tip,\" said Shivdeep Lande. "

With three matches slated to be played from Sunday onwards in the picturesque HPCA stadium set in the backdrop of mighty Dhauladhar ranges, it is a full paisa-vasool proposition for the cricket lovers from outside who combine tourism with their passion for the game. With the prospect of local economy soaring due to tourists' influx, the locals are eagerly awaiting from the beginning of IPL season-4 in Dharamshala.\n\nDharamshala town will witness 20,000 spectators beside hordes of VVIPs including politicians and industrialists from across India coming together on Sunday for the IPL match to be played between Kings-XI Punjab and Delhi Daredevils, was earlier known only as the temporary abode of Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual guru in exile. \n\nHill town is today frequented by Hollywood actors besides other regular tourists, is located on the lap of majestic Dhauladhar ranges.

Live telecast of matches played here are attracting more people now,\" he said.\n\nHimachal Pradesh tourism director, Arun Sharma, informed that in a bid to boost the tourism activity in Himachal Pradesh, state government has chalked out a three - pronged strategy to harness the tourist potential to the maximum. \"As a part of the strategy, the government on one hand is focusing upon development of various tourist circuits, strengthening the infrastructure and long term planning whereas on other hand launching schemes to cater to tourists of all classes and categories,\" he said.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has scrapped the practise of holding special exams and changes to this effect have been brought about in the Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) pertaining to Flight Crew Standards. \n\nIn April, the Times of India had reported that the daughter of Joint Director General of Civil Aviation, AK Sharan had cleared three out of the five CPL subjects in special exams, though she was not eligible to sit for even a single special exam session. \n\nSpecial exams are conducted in between the regular exam sessions. The DGCA conducts regular exam sessions once every three months. A candidate can apply to sit for a special exam, if s/he fulfills a list of eligibility criteria. Like for instance: the student should have cleared all the subjects, except one and cannot afford to wait for a regular exam session as the validity of his/her flying hours or that of other exam results would expire by then. Even if the candidate is eligible to sit for a special exam, there is no guarantee that the DGCA would allow him/her to appear for one as it is left to the discretionary power of the DGCA officials concerned. \n\nSpecial exams are not as transparent as regular exams. Unlike regular exams that are given by over 2,000 candidates in several centres across India, Special exams have about 10-15 candidates sitting in the DGCA office on a pre-decided date. The results of special exams are informed to the candidate a few days after it is held, while candidates sitting for regular exam sessions see their results online on the DGCA website.  What was also brow-raising was that only 10-15 percent students manage to pass in the regular exams, while in special exams more than 90 percent of those who appear clear the papers.\n\nThe CAR defines the new practise put in place of special exams. \n\n``In case of the requirements for issue of license expires due to delay in the conduct of written examination or in declaration of the result by the DGCA, the applicant may submit the documents for issue of license in DGCA pending results of the written examination in which he/she has appeared,'' said the new CAR.  \n\n``While submitting the documents, the applicant should clearly mention the name of the paper in which he/she will be appearing in the rescheduled examination or have appeared in the examination and the result is awaited,'' the CAR added. \n\nIn such cases, the date of application for such requests shall be considered provided the candidate passes the written examination in that session of written examination.

    "Story": "NEW DELHI: Stepping up pressure on chief minister B S Yeddyurappa, Karnataka Governor H R Bhardwaj on Saturday appeared to suggest a trial of strength for the BJP government in the wake of the Supreme Court quashing the Speaker's decision to disqualify rebel party MLAs.\n\nAfter a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said the Supreme Court judgement reversing the high court verdict in this regard as an endorsement of his stand that the floor test should be taken on the respective strength of the Assembly.\n\nRefusing to answer a question whether he would be advising a floor test afresh in the context of the Supreme Court order, he said \"it is too premature\".\n\nHe said the apex court judgement was a stricture against the Speaker and the chief minister.\n\n\"120 per cent. I had advised floor test (in October). It should be taken on the respective strength of the party without bringing them down. They (BJP government) resorted to exactly the opposite,\" Bhardwaj told reporters here.\n\nHe described his meeting with the Prime Minister as a courtesy call. He made it clear that there was no talk on the issue with the Prime Minister.\n\nTerming the Supreme Court judgement as \"very important\", Bhardwaj said, \"The Supreme Court restored the status quo. I have to study the case law and the ramifications of the order and put it to the (state) government.\"\n\nThe governor said that he will be writing to the state government after reaching Bengaluru.\n\n\"Supreme Court has now clearly said that the Speaker and chief minister acted in violation of Constitution and procedural norms in dealing with their MLAs,\" Bhardwaj said.\n\nThe governor said his view was that the floor test was very sacrosanct commitment and it should be carried out earnestly according to the Constitution rather than doing a head count.\n\nIn a jolt to ruling BJP in Karnataka, the Supreme Court yesterday quashed the disqualification of 16 MLAs ahead of the controversial October 2010 no trust motion, saying the Speaker acted in \"hot haste\" in favour of Yeddyurappa.\n\nMeanwhile, one of the BJP rebel MLAs and former fisheries minister Anand Asnotikar said the 11 legislators had never defected from the party and were only demanding a change in leadership.\n\n\"We never defected nor said anything about the party... We are against the leadership. We have gone to justice,\" he said.\n\nAbout the future course of action, Asnotikar said, \"We have to consult our supporters and for betterment of our state. We will hold a meeting. We are united.\"  "

The CPM and allies won in Kannur, Kozhikode, Kollam, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram, which all have significant Hindu concentration. Ezhavas, the community to which Achuthanandan belongs, were at the vanguard of Hindu consolidation for their man. Their pro-Achuthanandan fervour was evident in the Left's strong showing in Alappuzha where Congress had hoped to do well. \n\nThere were a few exceptions, but broadly, the Hindus gravitated towards the Left in reaction to the UDF's aggressive wooing of Christians and Muslims. In fact, Congress had sniffed the risk and decided to field state party chief Ramesh Chennithala to blunt the reaction among Hindus to the projection of Oomen Chandy as UDF's chief ministerial choice.

However, we are informed that there are only some 19 kirpan-wearing Sikhs who work at the airside at the Amritsar airport\" said she.\n\nShe asked the director general of the force to revoke the ban. \"We ask you to reassure us that Amritdhari Sikhs who are airside employees will not be banned from wearing their Kirpan at any Indian airport\" she said. \n\nThe United Sikh director also sought a meeting with the director general of the force to discuss the issue further.

    "PhotoCaption": "Jayalalithaa's willingness to forge alliance proved to be a masterstroke.",
    "Story": "TIRUCHI: In February this year, J Jayalalithaa reached out to actor-politician Vijayakanth and ceded 41 out of the 234 assembly seats to DMDK, a gesture uncharacteristic of the AIADMK chief. The seat offer took place a few days after the two leaders had engaged in a verbal duel. That marked the beginning of AIADMK's efforts to cobble together a coalition to match the formidable alliance that the DMK headed.\n\nJayalalithaa's action to rope in DMDK and many smaller parties proved to be a masterstroke. The 13-party strong alliance comprehensively won even in the northern districts of Tamil Nadu, where the DMK had banked on the combined strength of the Vanniyar-based PMK and Thol Thirumavalavan's Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi to make substantial gains.\n\nClearly, successive defeats in elections since 2004 had taught Jayalalithaa the importance of a strong alliance. In 2006, she went almost on her own against a formidable front of DMK-Congress-PMK-Left and had to settle with just 60 seats. This time, she showed an uncharacteristic willingness to negotiate and conceded seats from the AIADMK's share to Vijayakanth's DMDK and the Left.\n\n\"In fact, in the last elections itself, the AIADMK would have won but for the DMDK. In 50-odd assembly segments, DMDK's votes were higher than the winning margin of DMK candidates,\" said political observer Gnani.\n\nWhat the AIADMK-DMDK alliance did was to prevent a split in the anti-DMK votes. Many seasoned AIADMK leaders pitched for an alliance with the DMDK, which has a 10% vote spread across the state. They knew the damage the actor-politician could do to the party's prospects, if he chose to project DMDK as an alternative to both the DMK and the AIADMK.\n\nThe alliance, of course, faced numerous hurdles, especially after Jayalalithaa unilaterally released her party's list of candidates for 160 constituencies. This led to the Vaiko's MDMK snapping ties with the AIADMK. The Left parties and the Puthiya Thamilagam held a meeting with Vijayakanth sparking rumours that they intended to float a third front. But the differences were ironed out and seats sharing talks concluded. Again, when Vijayakanth kept away from the AIADMK front's mega rally in Coimbatore, there was talk of the alliance collapsing over the egos of the two leaders. \n\nAIADMK cadres say that although the alliance played a role in shaping the victory, there were several other factors that contributed, key among them, of course, Amma herself. \"The landslide victory is an indication of people's trust in Amma,\" said V Senthil Balaji, an AIADMK candidate. \"People trust that Amma could give a corruption-free rule,\" he says. Yes, the anti-incumbency wave that arose over the 2G scam added wind to her sails. "

    "Story": "KOCHI: The Congress-led UDF wrested power by winning 72 of the 140 seats in the Kerala Assembly, but buoyed by a spirited campaign by chief minister V S Achuthanandan the ruling the CPM-led LDF averted a rout in the state lashed until recently by an anti-incumbency wave.\n\nThe LDF won 68 seats, drastically improving its position from the humiliating defeats it had suffered in the Lok Sabha elections in 2009 and local polls. BJP's attempts to open account, however, came to a naught again.\n\nThe UDF's narrow victory raised fears of political uncertainty, even in the Congress because it has won just one seat above the magical number of 71 required to form the government. The coalition comprises of several parties representing strong interest groups as well as some tiny parties with just one or two MLAs.\n\nWhat compounds worries for Congress is the success of its allies. The Muslim League which contested 25 seats won 20 while the Kerala Congress (M) led by K M Mani returned in 10 of its 15 seats. The Congress could secure only 38 of the 82 seats where it had fielded candidates.\n\nUDF schemes to wrest a clean sweep by roping in leaders of certain communal groups seem to have failed to yield much dividends. \n\nOn the other side, the strong campaigns of VS against corruption, attack on women, against plundering of the environment and a host of related issues appear to have struck a chord among large sections of the people, especially women. Observers said LDF could have improved its position if the CPM went along with his campaign instead more honestly.\n\nThe voting patterns displayed a communal polarisatiton across the state with the minorities consolidating behind the UDF and the Hindu areas going with the Left. The Congress and allies won maximum seats in Muslim-dominated Malappuram and Christian belts like Pathanamthitta, Ernakulam, Kottayam and Pathanamthitta districts while the CPM and allies won in Kannur, Kozhikode, Palakkad, Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram. However, the UDF could not perform well in Thrissur which has a significant Christian population. Congress suffered setbacks in Idukki and Alappuzha where it was expected to fare better.\n\n\"We will sit in the opposition,\" VS said, adding that the Left would not engage in horse-trading or enter into opportunistic alliances to unseat the government.\n\nVS also blamed the UDF for stirring communal passions and taking support of communal outfits.\nParty state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan too echoed the view and said the Left Front would accept the people's verdict.\n\n\"We expected more numbers as we had performed well in the Lok Sabha and local body polls. I take the responsibility for this. We will examine the reasons,\" UDF's CM hopeful Oommen Chandy said.\n\nThe counting of votes gave several tense moments as it was proving to be literal sea-saw battle with fortunes favouring both the rival fronts alternatively. On several occasions the UDF and LDF were seen leading in equal number of 70 seats each. "
