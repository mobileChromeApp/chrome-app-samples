    <p>If you are connecting over the Internet, the computer you want to control is very likely to be protected by at least one firewall and router. If this is the case, you must:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Configure the computer's firewall to allow network communications through to a particular port (5900 by default).</li>
		<li>Configure the computer's router to forward network communications through to the same port. We recommend you assign a static IP address to the computer, for example <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</li>
		<li>Obtain the <a href="address-public.html">public network address</a> of the computer, which is that of the router, and use this to connect. We recommend that if your ISP changes your router's address periodically, you apply for a host name (using a service such as www.no-ip.com).</li>
	</ol>
